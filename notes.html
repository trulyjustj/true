    <p><strong> Romeo: If I profane with my unworthiest hand

    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:

    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand

    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,

    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;

    For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,

    And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Juliet: Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Romeo: O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!

    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Juliet: Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.</strong></p>

    <P><strong> Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.

    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purged. 105

    [kisses her]</strong></P>
    <p><strong>The onion is relative to the ogre due to Albert Einstein’s theory about relativity. Since as he said, “Everything is relative in terms of everything that may also relate to time.” This brings us back to the fact onions have layers. That of which ogres also share a similar feature in some sense. Though most donkeys wouldn’t be able to comprehend this fact due to their different ideology. Which states, “Ogres stink relative to onions which also stink.” Despite the fact that theory has been disproven by Shakespeare Shrekworthington the Fifth Junior. Concluding the fact that E=mc^5 which would allow that ideology to be eliminated. Quoted by Sun Tzu, “Lmao.”
